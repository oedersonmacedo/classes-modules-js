# classes and modules in JavaScript

 - #### Classes
    - The classes are a special type of function that act as a template for creating objects;
    - The classes aren't hoiting, no matter how they are declared;
    - Classes are made up of 3 types of members: constructor, prototype methods and static methods;
    - The constructor is invoked when a class is instantiated and serves to initialize a given object;
    - The prototype methods depends on an instance to be invoked;
    - Static methods don't depend on an instance to be invoked;
    - Classes works similarly to constructor functions;
    - It's possible to create a clas hierarchy using the extends keyword;
    - When declaring a constructor in the subclass, it's necessary to invoke the superclass constructor through super() before using the this reference;

# Classes and Modules in JavaScript

 - #### Classes
    - The classes are a special type of function that act as a template for creating objects;
    - The classes aren't hoiting, no matter how they are declared;
    - Classes are made up of 3 types of members: constructor, prototype methods and static methods;
    - The constructor is invoked when a class is instantiated and serves to initialize a given object;
    - The prototype methods depends on an instance to be invoked;
    - Static methods don't depend on an instance to be invoked;
    - Classes works similarly to constructor functions;
    - It's possible to create a clas hierarchy using the extends keyword;
    - When declaring a constructor in the subclass, it's necessary to invoke the superclass constructor through super() before using the this reference;
 - #### Modules
    - In ES6, or ECMAScript2015 it was specified in the language itself, based on the concept of import and export;
    - Through the keyword export it's possible to export any type of data existing inside a module;
    - To use modules in Node.js, the files must have the .mjs extension in addition to running with the --experimental-modules in older versions of node;
    - It's possible to use an alias in the import, renaming in which it's being imported;
    - Through the * it's possible to import everything that's being exported in a single object;
    - We can also import and export in a standard way using the keyword default;
    - Is the import order relevant? No, because when imported last, hoisting takes places;
 - #### Proxy and Modules
    - A proxy is capable of intecepting several types of operations on a target object;
    - There are methods, called trap, for several types of events related to an object such as apply construct, defineProperty,  deleteProperty,  get, getOwnPropertyDescriptor, getPrototypeOf, has, isExtensible, ownKeys, preventExtensions, set e setPrototypeOf;
    - The set method is invoked when a property is set on the object;
    - The deleteProperty method is invoked when a property is deleted;
    - The get method is invoked when a property is accessed;
    - The Reflect API has the same methods that exist in the Proxy, allowing the execution of different types of operations on the target object;
